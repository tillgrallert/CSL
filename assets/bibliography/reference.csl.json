For middle-class residents of late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Beirut, these debates took on critical importance. As Beirut was reshaped into a modern city, legal codes and urban projects pressed at the home from without, and imported commodities and new consumption habits transformed it from within. Drawing from rich archives in Arabic, Ottoman, French, and English―from advertisements and catalogues to previously unstudied government documents―<i>A Taste for Home</i> places the middle-class home at the intersection of local and global transformations. Middle-class domesticity took form between changing urbanity, politicization of domesticity, and changing consumption patterns. Transcending class-based aesthetic theories and static notions of \"Westernization\" alike, this book illuminates the self-representations and the material realities of an emerging middle class. Toufoul Abou-Hodeib offers a cultural history of late Ottoman Beirut that is at once global in the widest sense of the term and local enough to enter the most private of spaces.<br><br># Summary<br><br>- geographic and temporal focus: <br>    + Beirut, second half of 19th c to WWI<br>- topical focus: <br>- discipline: <br>- theoretical background / approach / hypothesis:<br>- core argument(s):<br>- sources:<br>- case studies:<br><br># Critique<br><br>- the book shows the same dating issues as the dissertation:<br>    + in the leading comment on dating she writes: \"The mali was a solar cal-endar, with a year that began on 13 March of the Gregorian calendar.\" (xiii)<br>    + \"used to gather weekly in the 1860s and 1870s to read and dis-cuss the latest in periodicals, such as Butrus al-Bustani’s al-Jinan and ‘Abd al-Qadir al-Qabbani’s Thamarat al-Funun.\" (4) These journals were established in **1870** and **1875**!",

        "abstract": "# Jerusalem, K.Nr. 154 / J. Nr. 2252, 17 Jul 1917, Dr. Brode to Reichskanzler Dr. MichaelisIm Anschluss an den Bericht vom 28.v.M.J.Nr.1964 K.Nr. 136\"Der Geschäftsführer des jetzt in Liquidation befindlichen Getreidesyndikats, Oberleutnant Dragoman Dr. Grobba [Dr. Fritz Grobba] hat dem kommandierenden General des XXII. Armeekorps Freiherrn von Kress über die diesjährige Ernte- und Verpflegungsaussichten einen Bericht erstatten [sic], dessen Abschrift ich mich beehre Euer Exzellenz zur hochgeneigten Einsicht anliegend zu überreichen. Was meinen Amtsbezirk bezw. die Etappeninspektion Jerusalem anlangt, so darf ich in folgendem die Ergebnisse dieses Berichts in kurzer Übersicht zusammenfassen. Ich bemerke dabei im Voraus, dass die von Oberleutnant Grobba kritisch verwerteten Zahlen, da auf türkischen Schätzungen beruhend, nicht unbedingt zuverlässig sein können, meines Erachtens jedoch wenigstens in ihren grossen Zügen annähernd richtig sein dürften, sodass sie die allgemeine Lage sowie deren zukünftige Entwicklung mit einiger Sicherheit erkennen lassen.Wie Euer Exzellenz aus den Vorberichten bekannt ist, hat im Bereich der IV. Armee die Verpflegungsfrage für die Zivilbevölkerung insofern eine endgültige Regelung gefunden als die **Zivil**behörde hiermit beauftragt worden ist. Die oberste Leitung ist jetzt dem Wali von Syrien (d.h. Damaskus) Tahsin Bey übertragen worden, der seinerseits wieder angeordnet hat, dass der Bedarf der Zivilbevölkerung durch die Etappeninspektionen durch (zwangsweisen) Ankauf sicher zu stellen ist. Auf diese Weise soll, wenigstens für einen bedeutenden Teil dieses Bedarfs, die  Fürsorge und die Verantwortung doch wiederum der Militärbehörde - Etappeninspektionen - zufallen.Der Etappeninspektion Jerusalem unterstehen:1. _Gänzlich_ d.h. sowohl bezüglich der Erhebung der Zehnten von der Ernte, wie des Verfügunsrechts über die Ernte: 1. Das selbständige Mutessariflik Jerusalem (Kazas: Jerusalem, Jaffa, Hebron, Berseba, Gaza) 2. Aus dem Berzirk der Provinz Syrien (Damaskus) der westliche Teil des Mutessarifliks Kerak (im Ostjordanlande) nämlich der eigentliche Kreis Kerak, der Zentralkreis Salt nebst dem Amtsbezirk Madeba.Anmerkung: Die Etappeninspektion umfasst demnach nicht den ganzen Teil _meines_ Amtsbezirks, zu dem das ganze Sandjak Kerak gehört.2. _Zumteil_ d.h. nur bezüglich Erhebung des (dopplten) Zehnten: + Von der Provinz Beirut, der Reg.Bezirk NablusDas vorraussichtliche Ernteergebnis in meinem Amtsbezirk, von Nablus also abgesehen, ist im eigentlichen Bezirk Jerusalem und im Ostjordanlande verschieden. Zunächst hat sich die Anbaufläche im Bezirk Jerusalem verringert, da ein Teil der Kazas Berseba und Gaza sich in Feindeshand befindet, ferner infloge der militärischen Einziehungen und Requisitionen Arbeitskräfte und Tiere fehlen und weil schliesslich dem Fellachen bei der drückenden Steuerlast und der nicht enden wollenden behördlichen Schikanen jede Lust fehlt, sein Land über seinen eigenen Bedarf hinaus zu bestellen. Beeinträchtigt wird das Ernteergebnis noch durch ungünstige Witterungseinflüsse. Diese Missstände fehlen im Ostjordanland gänzlich, dessen Bewohner im allgemeinen vom Militärdienste befreit sind, ihre Arbeitstiere besser dem militärischen Zugriff entziehen können und  schliesslich [...][...] Jerusalem unterstehenden Gebiete [...][...] sei es durch freien  Ankauf [...]Wird noch ein weiterer Zehnt von jedem Produkt zwangsweise angekauft, wie vorgeschlagen ist, so ermässigt sich der Fehlbetrag auf 1425000 kg Brotgetreide, 1220200 kg Viehfutter und 3093750 kg Trockengemüse. Dieser Fehlbetrag wäre dann wohl, da \"freie\" Aufkäufe im hiesigen Bezirk mit Rücksicht auf die Bedürfnisse der Zivilbevölkerung schwerlich mehr möglich sein würden, vom Norden her mit der Bahn heranzuschaffen. Bei diesen geplanten grossen Zwangsankäufen von insgesamt 3/8 der Ernte an Brotgetreide für die Armee bleibt der leidende Teil der Zivilbevölkerung. Ihr täglicher Bedarf ist von Djemal Pascha auf 250 gr Getreide (300 g Brot) festgesetzt worden; in Friedenszeiten verbrauchte der Landeseinwohner täglich 600 - 800 g Brot, so dass die jetzige Rationierung für ihn eine schwer erträgliche Einschränkung bedeutet. Es fragt sich aber, ob die Regierung überhaupt imstande sein wird, der Bevölkerung, die ihr zugemessene Menge verschaffen zu können. Nimmt man die gesamt Bevölkerungszahl der der Etappe Jerusalem unterstehenden Gebiete (Jerusalem, der westliche Teil von Kerak und Nablus) mit 612081 Seelen an - was vielleicht ziemlich genau stimmen könnte - , so würden diese jährlich  (250 g pro Kopf täglich) 55852300 kg Brotgetreide benötigen. Die Gesamternte an Brotgetreide (Weizen und Durra) beträgt aber überhaupt nur 5876800 kg, so dass diese also bei der geplanten knappen Rationierung nur einen geringen Ueberschuss von rund 3 Millionen kg lässt. Nun nimmt aber die Armee vorweg ihren Anteil von entweder 2/8 (nur von Weizen) gleich 10 Millionen kg oder aber vielleicht auch von 3/8 gleich 15 Millionen kg. Für die Zivilbevölkerung würde sich demnach ein Fehlbetrag von 7084301 bis zu 12084300 kg Brotgetreide ergeben.Dieser Fehlbetrag hat an sich nicht solche erschreckende Bedeutung, wie es auf den ersten Blick wohl erscheinen mag. Allerdings müsste ein etwaiger Ersatz von norden her mit der Eisenbahn herangeschafft werden, die neben ihren bisherigen unzulänglichen Leistungen für die Armeebedürfnisse schwerlich noch 12000t für die Zivilbevölkerung bewältigen könnte. Selbst wenn sie dazu imstand wäre, fragt es sich doch, ob die Ernteergebnisse in den Wilajets Damaskus oder Aleppo derartige sind, dass ein Betrag in dieser Höhe abgegeben werden könnte. Ich möchte es verneinen. Trotz alledem sehe ich aber die Lage nicht zu pessimistisch an; wohlgemerkt nicht etwa im Vertrauen auf eine etwaige gute Organisation und sparsame Wirtschaft - so etwas ist unter türkischer Leitung nun einmal unmöglich -, sondern weil trotz aller Statistik, schliesslich doch eine, wenn auch knapp ausreichende Menge an Lebensmitteln in unserem Besitz vorhanden ist. Jede hier nach einem einheitlichen Gesichtspunkte aufgestellte Statistik hat den Fehler, dass sie ein den Tatsachen nicht entsprechendes gleichmässiges Mass zugrundelegt. Die Bevölkerung lebt ja mit Vorliebe von Brot, wenn es aber nicht reicht, kann sie sich, wenigstens als Zusatz, der vor dem Verhungern schützt, mit anderen Produkten begnügen, wie Feigen, Kaktusfeigen, Apfelsinen, Weintrauben, Früchten usw. Die Bevölkerung ist ja im Grunde sehr genügsam und des öfteren in ihren grossen Teilen an Hungerperioden gewöhnt. Dazu kommt noch, dass die Verhältnisse in Stadt und Land verschiedenen sind. Gerade die Landbewohner werden Mittel finden, um einigermassen durchzukommen; nur für grössere Städte, vor allem Jerusalem, wird die Frage brennend werden. Hierfür besteht nach meiner Meinung die grösste Besorgnis. Trotz der schwierigen Ankaufs- und Transportverhältnisse - eine Eisenbahnlinie steht ja für die Versorgung Jerusalems aus dem Ostjordenlande nicht zur Verfügung - wäre es aber technisch möglich, auch diese Kalamatität zu bewältigen, wenn man eben nicht mit der geringen Leistungsfähigkeit und der Ungeschicklichkeit der türkischen Etappe rechnen müsste. Da auf dieser, wie bereits angeführt, letzten Endes doch die gesamte Fürsorge für die Verpflegung der Zivilbevölkerung ruht, die Etappe aber aller Voraussicht nach nicht einmal im Stande sein wird, den Heeresbedarf regelmässig zu decken, so wird sie notgedrungen die Zivilbevölkerung hungern lassen müssen. Der Schmuggelhandel wird ja die Leiden etwas mildern, die Wohlhabenderen Bevölkerungsteile werden sich ferner selbst genügend versorgen können. Die grosse Masse der Armen aber dürfte schwere Zeiten erleben. Unter diesen Umständen halte ich es keineswegs für unmöglich, dass man dann gelegentlich türkischerseits wiedereinmal die Frage wenigstens teilweisen Evakuierung von Jerusalem aufrollt.Die in Liquidation befindliche Getreidekommission hat auch jetzt noch der Regierung ihre Dienste zur Verfügung gestellt und hoffe, mit den ihr zu Transportzwecken über-lassenen 500 Eseln monatlich 125000 kg Getreide heranschaffen zu können. Dies würde ungefähr etwas mehr als der vierte Teil des monatlichen Bedarfs sein (250 g täglich für etwa 53000 Seelen). Die Getreidekommission wird daher zunächst, um wenigstens etwas vollkommen zu erreichen, den Bedarf der Wohltätigkeitsanstalten und bestimmter Bevölkerungsteile, darunter auch die deutsche Kolonie, gänzlich decken. Die Vorarbeiten hierzu sind im Gange.Wie die Sache sich nun weiter entwickeln wird bleibt abzuwarten.\"Dr. Brode- 3 copies attached.

The Young Turk Revolution led to a political mobilization of this class and wide popular participation in the public sphere that found its expression in many demonstrations and was coined \"civic Ottomanism\" by Michelle Campos.(S.1) There are characteristic features that allow to conceptualize a middle class: set of institutions and practices used by these actors (such as the print media, clubs, demonstrations, and petitions) as well as a rhetoric inspired by a mixture of authoritarian modernisation ideology, populism, liberal values, and utilitarianism. By the 1920s and 1930s these middle classes gradually merged with the aʿyān (s.2).",

To this end, many articles and news items appeared in al-Sharq to inspire Muslim unity around the figure of the caliph. Unity was presented as a crucial part of saving Muslims; disasters were predicted should the Ottoman Empire fall to the ‘infidels’. Sharīf Ḥusayn and his followers were explicitly or implicitly accused of splitting the umma and rendering the Ḥijāz and the remainder of independent Muslim territories vulnerable to British and other European imperialists. In 1916, Sharīf Ḥusayn launched a revolt in Mecca against the Ottoman Caliph and established a periodical, al-Qibla, to target the same audience. In al-Qibla, Ḥusayn presented the Committee of Union and Progress as amoral and irreligious usurpers of the caliph’s authority, and therefore undeserving of allegiance. In this article I analyse the discourse of the two competing sides by examining their propaganda on issues such as loyalty to the caliph, the unity of the Muslims and the formation of alliances with the Great Powers. I argue that Islam shaped the propaganda battle between the Ottomans and the sharīf to a greater extent than did Arabism or Turkism.",

In addition, he repeatedly returns to the 1880s (e.g. 278). The final decade, 1898-1908, is treated within less than 40 pages (296-332). Altogether this set-up dedicates more than half of the thesis to the first 5-6 of 33 years of publication, without ever commenting on or explaining this choice.

        "abstract": "[…]\"the great ‘coup d’Etat’ which took place in Turkey on the 24th July occupied all minds and arouses every emotion with the proclamation of the Constitution, in Damascus as in all other important centres in the Empire. Among its results worthy of remark here were (a) celebrations and festivities (b) dismissal or resignation oaf notoriously corrupt  officials (c) formation of clubs and associations (d) parliamentary elections (e) reforms in various governmental departments. (f) release or rehabilitation of political exiles or persons [xxx].Rejoicings and joyful manifestation are only coming now to an end, after lasting more than two months: more than 25 well organized great meetings were held int he different quarters of the city, mostly attended by several thousands [sic] demonstrators and spectators, and hundreds of speeches were delivered, all condemning autocracy as despotic & tyrannical and eulogizing liberty and constitutional government. About £2000 were spent on the festivities and had not notables of Damascus with the young Turks lately recommended their cessation they might have continued for another month or more. It is to be remarked with pleasure that all these gathering & demonstrations were conducted most orderly without any dispute or ill feeling among those who assembled.Many corrupt officials were either dismissed or withdrew themselves.The Alaybey of Gendarmerie, the Chief of Police, the Muhassebeji, six Caimacams of Cazas, Moh.d P. Adm [Muḥammad Pasha al-ʿAẓm] of Idara Mejliss with about 30 other minor officials vacated their posts, mostly to the general satisfaction of the public and it is debated now among ‘Young Turkey’ adherents whether it would be right to punish the officials who were led to bribery by the littleness of their pay & its frequent irregularity. Doubtless the proper course will be followed in leaving this matter to the jurisdiction  of Parliament when it assembles, and the ignorious[?] dismissal of the more corrupt, rapacious & outrageous among officials suffices for the moment. Moreover, the vacancies are not being easily filled up by really good substitutes, for such persons are at present  rare, and often unwilling to serve. Damascus Clubs & associations, besides the Union & Progress number now five viz Hurriyet, Ulema, Medical, Commercial, Free Ottoman besides a Shoemaker guild. the first two are showing much activity wh.[ich] is likely to excite mutation . The misapprehension & with uncalled solicitude Ulema are anxious to comcure [?sic] & uphold Islam against the liberal views of the Young Turks, while the latter have no intention at present to interfere with religious precepts. The first point of dispute was about women’s wear which the Ulema wanted to be cut on a very simple mode, one piece enveloping the whole body, and the liberals denied them the right of interfering with this matter which should be regarded as pertaining to individual free choice. In this campaign the Ulema were defeated but not without their rivals using threats of applying force.There is little record as to practical work effected [?] by other clubs though their moral influence cannot be other than good.The Parliamentary elections are under preparation the last two months and in some cazas the voters have already voted for the electors, but in Damascus city this process will begin in a week’s time. It is not even announced yet how many deputies will represent this Vilayet in the Parliament but it is supposed that they will be seven or eight. The Hauran people still reject their privilege to elect a deputy and the efforts of the government in dissuading them from this self-inflicted loss seem to be futile. The Mutessarif of Kerak lately resigned on grounds of health, but before doing so had been able to set going a local society or club for instruction of the people of his district who indeed are little  less backward &ignorant than this of Hauran.The reforms in the various departments of the government proceed slowly. The Municipality suppressed most improperly awarded pensions paid to persons doing nothing for it  and succeeded in amassing about £3000 through various economies. The Public Instruction Department formed a new chamber to consider the reorganization of the educational system in this Vilayet. In the departments no special reforms worth mentioning have been introduced but many are being talked of & discussed. The political exiles who had been releases or rehabilitated included many persons of rank, both military and civil. Mushir Fuad Pasha’s release was the occasion of great demonstrations in Damascus, but the rehabilitation of others, with a few exceptions, was not publicly noticed, for this disgraces persons were always enjoying personal freedom  and a very few persons knew that they were ‘Ikamet Mamours’ [iqāma maʾmūr]. The chief names among these were, Nouri P. Ferik of Cavalry, another Ferik called Nouri Pasha sent to live here without duties, Ferik Ibrahim Pasha (those three Feriks kept for Constantinople), Ferik Lt. Osman P., Liva Behjet Pasha (those two died recently), Colonel Bedri Bey (now of Liva Bedri P. in Constantinople). The Maàriz Mushiri [?] & his assistant, and many minor officials or private persons; such as members of the Bedr Khan family, numbering more than a hundred. Further as reported in desp. No. 32, the Ismailians subjected to religious persecution were pardoned. Happily no sort of disorder or riotous intention was displayed here for the purpose of releasing prisoners and ordinary criminals generally, as took place in some other places.\"Ḥijāz railway was completed in seven years and inaugurated on 1 Sep 1908. four of the five battalions employed for earthworks on the line were allowed to return to their garrisons. \"about 1400 of these battalions on expiry of service were disbanded. Moreover, the four battalions of the 40th Reg, sent to Medina from this Army Corps in June last, to guard the line, are also ordered back to their headquarters. At present only two battalions are to be kept there to take care of the line as regards repairs & protection.\" No aspirations to commence construction beyond Medina due to increasing Bedouin raids \"Public security in the Vilayet has been during the quarter satisfactory and order was properly kept. The Bedouins have been quiet & peaceful during the summer, and only on two or three occasions made petty rais & drove or carried away animals or goods but the spoils were restored to their owners without great difficulties.\" Druze and Bedouins seem under the spell of the government and calmly wait for the implementation of the promised reforms\"the crops this year were in general very good and the grain harvest in most of the districts of the Province was exceptionally abundant. The apricot produce was above the average while walnuts were much below. All prices of fruit and cereals are still high and the peasants this year will do well. An exception might be mentioned as  as regards locusts which made a perceptible damage in the Kalamoun district but had a very slight effect in some other Cazas. But the loss to the Vilayet in general has been small.As respects trade, no special remarks need be made; strikes at Beirut at the Customs and on local railways have produced only exiguous loss here. With reference to the latter we may note that public opinion judges that the smaller employés  were underpaid, while the profits of the Company & of its directors were considerable and the public at the same time ill served.Public health has been satisfactory on the whole this summer, but the Ain Fijeh water has not been received the general approbation anticipated which is to be regretted, as theres is absolute proof the it is the best & purest spring water of al this neighbourhood. Its distribution to all quarters of the city proceeds slowly.\"",

Eldridge serves for 19 years in Syria and has files all the placements under his jurisdiction.If the British adopted the French system of appointing salaried nationals everything would be fine. But under the current system he has to pick the most suitable foreign resident who is willing to serve as VC. The gentlemen are the best to be found on the spot.Strict rules for employing Dragomans and Cavasses laid down in 1863: 4 each for independent consulats at main places of the province; 3 at dependent ones, and 2 each at VC. He stuck to the rule.On arrival he instructed the VCs to reduce the number of protégés and \"deprived a large number of persons of British protection.\"The above mentioned report advised to allocate only 1 Dragoman and 1 Cavass to VCs, as this would relate to British VCs only, it is a grave step in diminishing the public image of Britain.Dragomans are local Ottoman subjects and unpaid as well, thus they are often absent with their own business and hence the necessity of 2 dragomans.A lengthy account of the duties and functions of the Beirut Consulate follows, finished with an account of the expenses for rent in comparison with Damascus: \"while only £32 is paid for the larger Consular residence and office in Damascus\".

These gazettes cut more deeply into non-elite society than has previously been suggested in the scant mentions of the popular press in precedent historiography of the Hamidian era.                 <br>By analysing and interpreting the late-Ottoman popular press, particularly that part written for and increasingly by women, I present shifting notions of Islam, Ottoman modernity, civic identity, and female gender at a time when these terms became increasingly alien as they were abstracted into the realm of contesting ideologies. At the same time, ironically, these notions became more quotidian and practical, more intimately woven into the daily lives of subjects of one of the last land-based, multi-ethnic empires to survive into the twentieth century. As Ottomans worked these ideological contests into their daily conflicts, choices, and actions, they constructed mentalites which I will attempt to portray, in part, through this study of one meeting ground of the ideological and the quotidian, the women's press of Istanbul in the Hamidian era.<br>My sources are the run of Hanimlara mahsus gazete with comparative reference to other publications for women and of more general interest, both in support of and in opposition to the Hamidian regime. In addition, I use monographs written by Hanimlara mahasus gazete's publisher, editors, and writers, and essays by their predecessors and contemporaries on issues of relevance to the gazette. From the Ottoman Basbakanlik archives I have drawn several hundred documents relating to publishing permission, censorship, and closure of magazines. I use these in concert with press laws of this period to reconstruct, briefly, state-press relations. I interweave research on architecture, markets and manufacture, photography, and the politics of display in an effort to place the popular press within the wider context of late-Ottoman political and intellectual histogriography. Finally, throughout the dissertation I make a first cut at incorporating comparative material from European, Egyptian, and Far Eastern historiography.",

The original telegram, as received from Constantinople, contained no reference to the use of military force against the Young Turk Committee in provincial towns. The perverted version of the telegram was made known in Karbala.<br>2. On the 16th instant there was a riot in which some of the grain stored were pillaged. The exportation of wheat has for some time been prohibited, and on the 14th and 15th instant it was rumoured that a certain Jew had received permission from Constantinople to export some wheat and that he was going to load it on the 16th. On that morning a crowd went to the Vali to protest. It is said that the Vali assured them that no order had been issued allowing the export of wheat, and it is said that the Vali strengthened his assurance by saying that when an attempt to load wad made it would time for the people to make serious complaints. It is not possible to know exactly what was said, much less what was understood, but the crowd went straight off to the grain stores and took what they could carry. It was at first reported that the loss was enormous, but the estimates have since been largely reduced, and I am inclined to think that the loss cannot have been very great. The populace took what it could during an interval of about an hour and a-half, but the entrances to the store are narrow and they were choked by the crowd, so much so that a number of the rioters found it convenient to pass their stolen wheat over the wall. In these circumstances a very large quantity of wheat cannot have been removed. Messrs. Lynch’s experience is that with the best arrangement, and all wheat in bags, not more than 100 tons could be removed in an hour and a-half. A very small proportion of this can have been taken by a struggling crowd. <br>One man claimed compensation for about 600l. [£ 600] worth of wheat which he said he held on behalf of a British subject and which he said had been pillaged during the riot. I went to his place of business to examine his books, and he then said that he did not want the intervention of the Consulate and would settle the matter himself.<br>Another man who claimed compensation on behalf of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. of London had to admit that he could not produce proof that any Court would accept. <br>A third man’s claim is still under consideration, but from what I have heard I am pretty fairly certain that it will not stand examination.<br>There is no doubt that all of these men have lost wheat, but they cannot prove that it was the property of British subjects.<br>3. There are a number of deserters about Bagdad who are a continual source of &lt;pb/&gt; danger to peaceful people. I understand that the Commander of the VIth Army Corps has written to Constantinople to say that it is necessary either to come to some settlement with them or to shoot them.<br>4. The Young Turk Committee at Karbala has made all the officials publicly swear loyalty to the Constitution, but the Mutessarif shows a strong dislike to interference, and the Vali of Bagdad is said to be troubled with many differences between the two parties.<br><br>I have, &amp;c. …",

A telegram was sent by this Party to the murdered Grand Vizir controversing Reforms demanded by the Union + Liberty Party (Titilafiyin) at Paris. The telegram has Many of the signatures turned to be falsely signed without the knowledge of their owners.The Local Press here and at Beirut opened a voley of a severe  criticism and exposed the ex-deputy's name blaming and attacking him for a speech he delivered on the occasion in which he insulted in low terms persons of high standing + good reputation from  the Union + Liberty Party, such as the ex-deputy Shukri Bey Asali and Abdul Wahab Eff. Inglisy, who in their turn convoked a meeting and a telegram was sent on behalf of the Damascene people in general endorsing the reforms demanded by the Paris Party  tho that first tel sent by the Paris Party and and dementing a telegram was the second sent  by the Union + Liberty Progress Party at Damascus. However the idea of decentralization has been as above referred hushed up for the time being but it is more likely to reappear in a more vigorous form.The Sanitary Dept. + Private Doctors report bad Public health during the quarter; Scarletine fever is now at an end but was for about two months derrating nearly  months an epidemic in this district + in its surroundings. At Baalbek it is reported that hardly any house escaped the visit by this disease. Death however did not exceed 7 to 8 %.Small pox made its appearance first in the Hauran district and then here. But the Sanitary Dept. has taken the usual necessary measures by vaccination to fight it which is now disappearing. Several fatal cases of typhoid fever have been reported and it still exists in different quarters of the town.Among the high officials removed may be mentioned H.E. the General Suleiman Faik Pasha, of the VIII Army Corps, order from the Ministry of War at Consple. reached this quarter  while he was on an inspection tour at Homs + Palmyra. H.E. left soon after his arrival to Damascus and his place has been occupied by H.E. the Cpt. Moh.d Shefik Pasha. It is alleged that the removal of ex-general is due to the instigation of the ex-1st Etat Major (Nouri Bey) […] His removal nevertheless has been much regretted on account of his kind and gentle character.On the 22nd of May two insubordinate Rediff infantry battalions to the number of about 700 arrived from Yemen, they behaved badly in the town and on  one occasion policemen at Souk Ali Pasha who trying to arrest one of them on acc.t of drunkness + ill behaviour  was badly handled by them, and they succeeded in getting their like ration. This incident insubordination having ended in success encouraged the Rediff battalion infantry of Nebk to the number of about 150 men to fully ar to make a mutiny: Fully armed they proceeded to the Big Omiades Mosque and disobeyed orders, demanding also their liberation (Tizkarahs), H.E. The ex-General + the Vali blocked up the Mosque by gendarmes + Policemen  and decided to famish out the revolting soldiers and sever measures were to be taken but a telegraphic order was received  from Consple to the Ministry of War at Consple to grant  them their liberation. Thus Badr eddin Bey (Nakib el Ashraf) with several other Ulamas were sent to the Mosque who preached  the revolted soldiers were asked to yield and their liberation was guaranteed which indeed was given to them in the same day. This incident of Sleakness on the Part of the Mil. Auth. made a very bad impression on the native people here who are loosing faith in the Gov.t Power. This incident will undoubtedly encourage others whenever opportunity is presented.The season product proved very good. Fruits are very abundant especially apricots. The coming season however is not very promising for cereals as rain was quite short at the end. \"Admin changes: in the districts.- the chief of police in Damascus, Amīn Bey, was removed to Beirut and replaced with the Damascene Muḥammad Efendi Qudmānī - most members of the penal division of the istiʾnāf court have been dismissed; providing all the names",

The first, EAP119, digitised the collection of historical periodicals in al-Aqṣá Mosque Library in Jerusalem (Al-Quds) in 2007.2 Two subsequent projects recorded manuscripts in al-Jazzār Mosque Library in Acre (ʿAkkā) (EAP399 in 2010) and al-Aqṣá Mosque Library in Jerusalem (EAP521 in 2012).3 After tracing a short history of the two libraries and outlining the development of the early Arabic press in Palestine, this contribution makes the case for the urgency of digitisation and provides a brief account of the digitisation process along with the challenges that the projects had to overcome. <br>",

Ḥadīqat al-Akhbār (1882-88), Suriye (incomplete), al-Ahrām (1882-1909), al-Bashīr (1877-1909), al-Jawāʾib (incomplete), al-Laṭāʾif (1886-1896), Lisān al-Ḥāl (1877-1909), al-Maḥabba (1899-1908), al-Maḥrūsa (1881, incomplete), al-Muʾayyid (1907-10, incomplete), al-Muqaṭṭam (1889-1909), Thamarāt al-Funūn (1882-1887) (368-369). In addition to the major Arabic journals of the time, and the French and British consular archives from Damascus and Beirut! From reviewing the main body of the text, it seems as most references are to the consular archives with only occasional reference to the newspapers or to much smaller samples than claimed in the bibliography. to further detail some administrative changes and the like. Thus, references to issues of Lisān date mostly to 1877-1880 with some issues of 1882/86 and a few of later years. Events are almost always established through the consular files first. Thus, he misses the Asʿad Efendi episode in his discussion on public security. - the excerpt covers the 1908 events (241-256)",

It evaluates the methodological and practical challenges of digital history as rooted in the socio-technical infrastructures of the Global North when applied to the Global South. It does so using a case study of four Arabic journals from Baghdad, Beirut, Cairo, and Damascus. After outlining the need for building a corpus and the challenges presented by this effort, this article explores a digital corpus of a total of circa 2.65 million words through (social) network analysis and stylometric authorship attribution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Grallert","given":"Till"}],"container-title":"Geschichte und Gesellschaft","container-title-short":"GuG","DOI":"10/gkhrjr","editor":[{"family":"Lässig","given":"Simone"}],"issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,10]]},"language":"en","page":"58 - 89","title":"Catch Me If You Can!
